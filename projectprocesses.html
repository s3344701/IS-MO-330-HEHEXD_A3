                <h2 id="what">What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn't worked well?</h2>
                <p>We have learnt that good communication ensures great teamwork within the group and that this only comes from trusting in each other and forming a social bond between us. And that is what worked great for us in this group project, we were all clear and supportive of each other and communicated often when problems arose. Whether the communication came from online meetings or MS Teams text chat, we always had regular communication.
                    What didn't happen to work as well and could do with some improvement, was our time management. It wasn't the worst but it wasn't up to the standard which we would've liked it to be at. Often we found ourselves completing tasks with only a few hours until the deadline and scheduled times.</p>
<br>
                <h2 id="mentor">Mentor</h2>
<br>
                <h2>What use did you make of your Mentor?</h2>
                <p>We made some use of our mentor in the stand-up meetings, asking for feedback and input when we required it. For example clarifying parts of the assignments, asking for input on ways to implement features within the application and design choices within the application.</p>
<br>
                <h2>What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you?</h2>
                <p>We made some use of our lecturer in guiding us. Especially at the start when we were forming a plan for the project as he was able to suggest some things in order to make our lives easier. One aspect that we would have liked more assistance with would have been the designing of the application in regards to system context diagrams and similar design aspects.</p>
<br>
                <h2>What were the group processes for communication?</h2>
                <p>The group's main form of communication was through Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams was used as our hub to communicate our ideas and have group meetings. Most of the discussions took place during those meetings as we worked as a group to effectively discuss matters at hand and schedule the next meetings, which were then promptly put into our other form of communication; Trello. Trello was used to organise each member's tasks and to communicate to each other member what each person was responsible for. We also used it as a platform to keep track of what was required in each assignment.</p>
<br>
                <h2>How effective were they?</h2>
                <p>Overall both Microsoft Teams and Trello were very effective in regards to organisation and communication between each team member.</p>
<br>
                <h2>Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?</h2>
                <p>The only change we made since the start of the semester is that we started to schedule more meetings as time progressed, realising that we, as a group, needed to communicate more often.</p>
