        <p>Assuming that our project successfully attracts funding for further development, we would be able to manage a team of four people who will 
            now deliver the new project outcomes. Listed below are the four position descriptions of people that we would employ to take our project 
            to the next phase.</p>

            <figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> Software Development</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A software developer would be responsible for the implementation of features and ensuring that each feature works correctly. 
            Their role would be to produce clean and meaningful code, troubleshooting, debugging and upgrading software. This will be 
            extremely helpful for the whole functionality of the app and ensuring that no errors will occur when consumers are using our app.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="ui">#2 UI Designer</h2>
        <figure id="uidesign" class="imagec">
            <img class="imagec" src="images/uidesign.png" alt="System Context Diagram" width="75%">
            <figcaption><b>Figure 2.</b> User Interface Design</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A User Interface Designer will be responsible for the layout and user interface of our app and will play a big role in designing the look and 
            feel of the app. If an application has perfect functionality but a user interface that isn't appealing, chances are that our app 
            won't be very memorable to consumers. A UI designer needs to have plenty of experience in their field and have an understanding of 
            what app users like to see in various mobile applications.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="digital">#3 Digital Marketing Manager</h2>
        <figure id="digitalmarket" class="imagec">
            <img class="imagec" src="images/digitalmarket.png" alt="System Context Diagram" width="70%">
            <figcaption><b>Figure 3.</b> Digital Marketing</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A digital marketing manager is responsible for creating market campaigns and advertisements on the digital platform. Most 
            of these advertisements will likely be on social media platforms aimed at the younger demographic who are just getting into 
            fitness, of course our app is inclusive for all ages but word of mouth is the best free advertising and spreading our advertisements 
            on social media is the perfect way to get young people talking about our app. The marketing manager will be responsible for this and 
            should be skilled in knowing how to accomplish this task.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="data">#4 Data Analyst</h2>
        <figure id="dataAnalysis" class="imagec">
            <img class="imagec" src="images/data analysis.png" alt="System Context Diagram" width="65%">
            <figcaption><b>Figure 4.</b> Data Analysis</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A data analyst will mainly be responsible for collecting user data into a database for added security with the login feature. 
            Meaning that consumers will be able to record their progress on different devices all with the same account. A data analyst will 
            also help in creating and storing large data for the recipe book feature as the app will need to search a wide variety of foods when 
            consumers input their meals. Certain database programming languages will be a key skill and requirement such as knowledge of SQL, mySQL, 
            SQLite, mongoDB or Oracle.</p>
