                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
                <p>It has been pretty demotivating to do most daily tasks in 2020, so as first year university students, our motivation for this project was to try and stay as healthy and as fit as possible during lockdown. There are plenty of apps out there that encourage users to keep fit and track their progress, but the amount of apps that really excel in motivating users to actually exercise and stick to a healthy diet daily are quite limited.</p>

                <p>We "HEHEXD" aimed to overcome this problem with our project app called "Power Up", which is an android application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and gives rewards for achieving certain goals each month. It has the ability to share results on weight, steps, meals consumed, etc, to others through social media and other users of "Power Up". The "Power Up" app can provide detailed graphs and statistics on users' fitness results and can provide them with personalised recipes and motivational videos based on their daily or monthly goals.</p>

                <h2 id="aimandgoals">Aim and Goals</h2>
                <p><b>Project Aim:</b> To create a fitness app that allows people to stay fit and healthy amidst this pandemic, and even after our lives are back to normal.</p>
<br>               
                <ol>
                    <li>Feedback Service:
                        We will be setting up an instant feedback service for the user to report their issues while receiving the food or having the food. To Achieve this, we will open online chat center for user to report their issue also a hotline for the user to contact us immediately, for the hotline we will be running 24 hours and we will make sure each customer won’t wait for too long, therefore, we have employed more than 20 people within the office to just take hotline calls only and the online chat will also have 20+ people in charge. For the Day shift and Night Shift there will be another 20+ people working for hotlines and Online Chat, Day Shift and Night Shift both have different employees in charge for 24 hours. That way our communication between the customer and the business is efficient, the business can make changes once they receive the feedback. This will help the business gain newly registered customer when we can provide efficient service like this to solve customer’s issues immediately.</li>
                    <li>Variety of Features:
                        Our App will be designed to have 5 Minimum Viable Features and this ensures the minimal function of our fitness App, which different type of MVF, the app is able to perform different assistance to different users when it comes to customer needs. For example: Social Sharing, as a fitness App we would like to user to share their result of their own progress and able to share to anyone they want, that way user has the complete control of each Features and willing to continue using it. Same with all the other Features it is designed to suit the best for Fitness User, basically all features were designed to suit Fitness user and only Fitness users. We also Got some extended feature to ensure our features were not only just 5, by having more features will definitely increase the use rate of our app and here I will introduce the reward system, once user reaches certain goals of their own goal, they will get free rewards from the system, such as gift cards, private trainer sessions and so on. Overall, the more feature we have, the better service we can apply to fitness users and maintain our business picture. </li>
                    <li>Design the App in focus of user friendly:
                        When the design of our App is completed. The App can be operated and download on Pc and Smartphone. For Pc user they will need to visit our main website to download this App, for Smartphone users it can be download through App Store or Google Store depends on which operating system (Android / IOS) the user is using. The App will allow the user to track when the food is ready and the tracking starts from the time when the order has been made, it will show the cooking time, delivery time and current position of our driver. It also has mini cooking games for users to play, once they have finished a certain level or the whole game they will be rewarded for discounts or even a free meal. Each Week the business will announce new dishes and for every dish been announced, the business will pick 10 random winners from the existing customers letting them try out this first, and if reasonable feedback can be provided with the customer will have to receive a discount for the next order. The message of rewards will be sent to the Customer’s email. </li>

                <p><b>Project Requirements: </b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The app should contain all the five Minimum Viable Features (Calorie Counter, Goal Setting, Social Sharing, Recipe/ Meal suggestions and Motivational videos)</li>
                    <p><b>Calorie Counter:</b> This feature of our application will work by the user inputting the name of the item into a search bar, once entered the area below will update with any relevant items. If the user then presses on the item in the area below a more detailed description showing all the nutritional facts about that item will appear, the user will be able to change the amount (weight) and the nutritional values should adjust accordingly. The user can add that item to the tracker from within the detailed description or from the main screen. </p>
                    <p><b>Goal Setting:</b>This feature of our application will let the user save goals that suit them. We will give each goal a level system. As we all know not all people that exercise every day, therefore they must start from the beginning of getting fit or healthy. And Lev 1 goals will help the users to achieve their very first beginner goal by letting the user get used to the Tasks or getting used to the habit of exercising. And it will stop at lev 3. Lev 3 is where the body builder’s goals, and suggestion will be made to alert user this is from some professional bodybuilders’ goal. Each Lev of goals will help different users to achieve their own suitable meaning of being healthy.</p>
                    <p><b>Social Sharing:</b>This feature of our application allows users to share their progress and results with their friends and family over other social media applications such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. They can send other people a small report of their achievements over any period of time that they choose, e.g. 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month etc. With this feature, users can also send their progress to other users of our application and compare their results side by side with their friends if they use our application. This feature will be fairly easy to implement as it simply involves grabbing the user's inputs of their progress and printing it into a nice template for sharing to other social media applications, such as Messenger, Instagram, Facebook, etc. If the user does not have any social media applications, they can also share this information in an email format, as if they were simply sharing a YouTube video or website.</p>
                    <p><b>Recipe/Meal Suggestion:</b>This feature of our application has the ability to give the user meal suggestions. The app will recommend ingredients/meal alternatives based on the past meal history and the type of exercise or goals needed to be achieved. The app will also allow you to pick custom meal so users will not be limited to recommended options.</p>
                    <p><b>Motivational Videos: </b> This feature of the application will show the user motivational videos which are to keep users motivated to do some fitness or exercise.</p>
                    <li>The app should be completed and presented by the 21st of October 2020</li>
<br>
                    <li>App must be user friendly for people of ages 12+</li>
                    <p>This app can be used by kids and teens aged 12-18 under parental guidance as the it contains in-app purchases.</p>
                    <li>App should cater for people with special needs</li>
                    <p>The app contains larger text to help people with special need and people of older age read. It also contains contrasting colour modes such as dark mode which reduces the strain on the eye.</p>
                </ol>
<br>
                <p><b>Stakeholders:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Members of the project team (HEHEXD)</li>
                    <li>Mentor and Tutor Ivan Sun</li>

                    <li>Product User group</li>
                </ol>
<br>
                <p><b>Limitations:</b></p>
                <P>We have mainly been limited by the resources we have to create the app,  if we were able to purchase map API key/s we would have been able to implement the Exercise and Geolocation Extended viable feature. If we had more time, we would have been able to learn more about app development in Android studio as this was the first time 5 out of 6 us using Android Studio.</p>
