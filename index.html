                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
                <p>It has been pretty demotivating to do most daily tasks in 2020, so as first year university students, our motivation for this project was to try and stay as healthy and as fit as possible during lockdown. There are plenty of apps out there that encourage users to keep fit and track their progress, but the amount of apps that really excel in motivating users to actually exercise and stick to a healthy diet daily are quite limited.</p>

                <p>We "HEHEXD" aimed to overcome this problem with our project app called "Power Up", which is an android application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake and gives rewards for achieving certain goals each month. It has the ability to share results on weight, steps, meals consumed, etc, to others through social media and other users of "Power Up". The "Power Up" app can provide detailed graphs and statistics on users' fitness results and can provide them with personalised recipes and motivational videos based on their daily or monthly goals.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>I first became curious about the world of IT from a young age when I was introduced to computers as my father had a job in IT managing databases in a small company for a couple of years. But it wasn't until I was 16 years old that I really took an interest in IT and when I first realised how important it is in daily life. I studied business management in high school at 16 years old and that was where I first understood how businesses would fail without information technology. It wasn't until the following year that I decided that I wanted to be a part of the IT industry when I first attended multiple university open days. The faculty that stood out the most to me, out of every university I went to, was always the 'Information Technology' faculty, and I knew that I wanted to study IT once I had finished high school.</p>
                <p>I've always been interested in mobile applications and was delighted when our group all shared the same interest in making a fitness mobile application for our project assignments. I enjoy staying fit and working out especially during the unfortunate events of COVID-19 so designing a fitness application was of great interest to me.</p>
                <p>I would definitely say that my stronger points within this project would be the presenting of our project and design as I find it easy to express myself and talk to others. On the other hand, I would say that my coding and programming abilities are definitely my weaker points when it comes to this project. I will definitely need to brush up on those skills in order to contribute to the technical side of this project.</p>
                
                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>I was assigned to MVF#3 (Social Sharing) and was responsible for the coding, design and written descriptions of MVF#3 through Android Studio, Figma, Visual Studio Code and Github. This follows along the lines of a software developer or UI designer.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>Ever since I was young, the innovative technology around me has always pique my interest for IT. My friends early on from primary school started coding and making applications for games or just to prank people around. They enlighten me into knowing that IT can be a great and powerful tool into improving the way we function as a human being around the world, hence I believed and still believe that going further into IT would be very important. Because of this, during my early days in high school I made a game using Unity and a simple application using Visual Basic.</p>
                <p>My interest and passion for IT falls under the designing of a user interface and to the programming side, as I found out after doing this project that strongest point fell into designing a UI and coding with Java. However, by doing this project I have also learned new ways of coding more efficiently with Java and new functions I could use such as parsing through a JSON file.</p>

                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>In this project, I was mainly assigned to the Recipe minimum viable feature in which I had to design the UI, diagram and the written description for this section. In terms, of diagram I was assigned to making a System Context Diagram of the system and an Activity diagram of the Recipe MVF. On the programming side however, my role was to lay the foundation of the Android app such as the navigation bar and the main individual pages. I was also assigned to coding the home page and coding the Recipe MVF entirely.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>My interest and passion for IT have started since I was seven years young; I was just amazed by how a computer could do many different things. I am particularly interested in the role of a Cyber Security Analyst and have a growing interest in the field of Data Science.</p>
                <p>I am interested in designing the application and would like to code a part of it. My major weakness is that I am not a good coder so I need to improve on it. For this project, my major challenge as previously mentioned is coding and to become a better coder I have got help from Jeremy and also watching videos that teach java. The skills I had before this project were basics of HTML/CSS and app designing.</p>
                
                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>I was assigned to the roles of creating a logo for our app and also the responsibility of the three extended viable features. I have done all the written descriptions, Figma prototypes for these features. I have also done the coding for the splash screen of the application and I have also done a part of the coding for the three websites Assignment 1,2,3 respectively. This follows along the lines of a UI designer and a software developer role.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>My interest in this application mainly came from improving my own health and the health of others during the current circumstances with the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
                <p>Some of the skills that I had before taking this project include some knowledge in Java and HTML and the ability to work well in a team-based environment.</p>
                <p>I acquired a few new skills from this course which include gaining a better understanding of Visual Studio Code (HTML) and GitHub. I also became more accustomed to using Figma for prototype creation and working in a team-based environment. Finally, I gained some knowledge in Android Studio, but not enough to say that I'm confident in it.</p>

                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>My assigned role for the project was to be working as both a front-end and back-end developer, working on both the design of the application as well as the coding for the calorie counter feature of our application.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>My interest in this topic was developed during year 12 at a very early stage. Since my school had the option for me to study IT I did pick it up and went with it for a year. I was going to drop anytime if I didn't like it but in the end, it taught me many interesting techniques and skill with computer and what other smart devices can do. My skill at this point is very limited as I just finished a year of IT course and jumped into studying IT at RMIT University. I had some basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JAVA and a bit of Python. Not good them but just some basic stuff. What skills acquired from completing this project, I would say many. One of them would be my ability to work in a team-based environment and my programming skill definitely improved as well from using Android Studio and from Figma code design as well. More insights on how to Github and Visual Studio code with HTML as well.</p>
                
                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>My Roles in this project is just to design my MVF(Goal Setting) and code it to the APP using AS, for design, I used Figma for most of the Goal Setting Page design and As for all the Page to function in an APP. Basically half like the design people and the other half would be like a developer.</p>

                <p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
                <p>My interest in the topic is something related to designing. In this topic is something like using Figma and creating the layout on Android Studio. And little bit more about creating application.</p>
                <p>The skills before working on the project are some little and basic skills for HTML, CSS and Figma from the previous semester. The acquired skills through completing the project is a little bit more of HTML, Figma and Android Studio. For HTML, I used HTML the previous semester but it was just a paragraph. So something like a table for HTML is I never used before so this is acquired skill while working through projects. My weak points are coding. </p>

                <p><b>Assigned Roles</b></p>
                <p>For the Figma I used the Anima to play the video. This is the one new skill I got by completing this project. Android Studio is just everything, this is my first time to use the Android Studio. I’m not really confident with the coding. I would say my strength is designing the screen for users. Something like using the Figma, it's not really good but I think this is better than other staff.</p>

                <h2 id="aimandgoals">Aim and Goals</h2>
                <p><b>Project Aim:</b> To create a fitness app that allows people to stay fit and healthy amidst this pandemic, and even after our lives are back to normal.</p>
                <p>Listed below are 3 goals that we believe will help us to achieve our aim of allowing people to build up their fitness and health during the current lockdown and beyond.
                </p>
<br>               
                <ol>
                    <li>Calorie Count Tracking:
                        In order to achieve the aim of our project, a great way to keep people healthy and on top of their fitness, is by implementing certain features such as calorie counter that lets users search through a database of meals and add the meals they've consumed throughout the day to a journal. This calorie counter will calculate the calories in each meal they have consumed based on portion sizes. This goal is to about letting consumers track their diet so that they feel energised and as fit as possible.<br>
<br>
                    <li>Recipe/Meal Suggestions:
                        While tracking calories is the main feature of our project, another goal we have to help achieve our aim is to give consumers recipe and meal suggestions based on their calorie count and meals consumed. If a user has certain tastes and prefers to eat certain meals over others, our app will make suggestions on what other types of healthy meals they would enjoy and how to cook them with detailed recipes. This goal is all about encouraging users to try new healthy foods that will drastically improve their diet if they happen to be consuming meals that aren't necessarily considered 'healthy'.</li>
<br>
                    <li>Rewards System:
                        Because our aim is all about encouraging people to stay fit and energetic during this unfortunate pandemic, our third goal is to provide users with rewards for achieving certain milestones such as 10,000 steps taken in one day, or lost 2kg in a week, etc. Once a user achieves a milestone, they will be rewarded with fitness points that can be exchanged for discounts and goodies from third party fitness websites and businesses.</ol>
<br><br>
                <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
                <p><b>Project Title: POWER UP Melbourne</b></p>
<br>
                <p><b>Project Requirements: </b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The app should contain all the five Minimum Viable Features (Calorie Counter, Goal Setting, Social Sharing, Recipe/ Meal suggestions and Motivational videos)</li>
                    <p><b>Calorie Counter:</b> This feature of our application will work by the user inputting the name of the item into a search bar, once entered the area below will update with any relevant items. If the user then presses on the item in the area below a more detailed description showing all the nutritional facts about that item will appear, the user will be able to change the amount (weight) and the nutritional values should adjust accordingly. The user can add that item to the tracker from within the detailed description or from the main screen. </p>
                    <p><b>Goal Setting:</b>This feature of our application will let the user save goals that suit them. We will give each goal a level system. As we all know not all people that exercise every day, therefore they must start from the beginning of getting fit or healthy. And Lev 1 goals will help the users to achieve their very first beginner goal by letting the user get used to the Tasks or getting used to the habit of exercising. And it will stop at lev 3. Lev 3 is where the body builder’s goals, and suggestion will be made to alert user this is from some professional bodybuilders’ goal. Each Lev of goals will help different users to achieve their own suitable meaning of being healthy.</p>
                    <p><b>Social Sharing:</b>This feature of our application allows users to share their progress and results with their friends and family over other social media applications such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. They can send other people a small report of their achievements over any period of time that they choose, e.g. 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month etc. With this feature, users can also send their progress to other users of our application and compare their results side by side with their friends if they use our application. This feature will be fairly easy to implement as it simply involves grabbing the user's inputs of their progress and printing it into a nice template for sharing to other social media applications, such as Messenger, Instagram, Facebook, etc. If the user does not have any social media applications, they can also share this information in an email format, as if they were simply sharing a YouTube video or website.</p>
                    <p><b>Recipe/Meal Suggestion:</b>This feature of our application has the ability to give the user meal suggestions. The app will recommend ingredients/meal alternatives based on the past meal history and the type of exercise or goals needed to be achieved. The app will also allow you to pick custom meal so users will not be limited to recommended options.</p>
                    <p><b>Motivational Videos: </b> This feature of the application will show the user motivational videos which are to keep users motivated to do some fitness or exercise.</p>
                    <li>The app should be completed and presented by the 21st of October 2020</li>
<br>
                    <li>App must be user friendly for people of ages 12+</li>
                    <p>This app can be used by kids and teens aged 12-18 under parental guidance as the it contains in-app purchases.</p>
                    <li>App should cater for people with special needs</li>
                    <p>The app contains larger text to help people with special need and people of older age read. It also contains contrasting colour modes such as dark mode which reduces the strain on the eye.</p>
                </ol>
<br>
                <p><b>Stakeholders:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Members of the project team (HEHEXD)</li>
                    <li>Mentor and Tutor Ivan Sun</li>
                    <li>Mentor and Lecturer Dr. Isaac Balbin</li>
                    <li>Project testers (Team members and friends of the members in the team)</li>
                    <li>Product User group</li>
                </ol>
<br>
                <p><b>Limitations:</b></p>
                <P>We have mainly been limited by the resources we have to create the app,  if we were able to purchase map API key/s we would have been able to implement the Exercise and Geolocation Extended viable feature. If we had more time, we would have been able to learn more about app development in Android studio as this was the first time 5 out of 6 us using Android Studio.</p>
