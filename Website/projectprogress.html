        <h2 id="1">Description</h2>
        <p>Description
            When we first started this project, we began with what our project was going to be. As a group we chose a mobile fitness application because we felt that during the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic that many peoples health and fitness would be poor. This application would be beneficial for us as a group as well as the general public. After we had decided on the topic of this project, we transitioned to the planning phase, deciding on the goals of the project as well as the scope which would be met with specific features to achieve the goals.
            <br><br>
            Our planning phase was not too long, we managed, as a group, to decide on which features to implement into our application relatively quickly. The biggest challenge however was that all of us had not done a mobile application before and we lacked the knowledge and experience required to actually implement the features and to estimate the time required to do so. After some discussion, we had formulated a list of features that would exist in a working prototype of this project, which included some extra features if time permitted to implement them.
            <br><br>
            Initially the group did not progress compared with the plan which had been created as the group was confused with what was required for the assignments and didn’t realise that coding was meant to be done across the whole duration of the course and not just for the third assignment. However once that confusion had been rectified, the group, for the most part, was able to get their work done according to a more condensed plan.
            <br><br>
            Dead-ends<br>
            In regards to social sharing, when the share button is pressed it would be ideal to send it to the specific social media platform (e.g. Facebook), but this requires an API, which we couldn’t use as it costs money.
            <br><br>
            Pivotal decisions made<br>
            A pivotal decision made was the platform on which we wanted our application to be on, in the end we decided on Android. This is mainly because it is much easier to code an application with, as well as the majority of the group having android phones, making it easier to do testing. Another important decision made was the software used for development of the application; as a group we chose Android Studio. We chose Android Studio because it is well known and the language in which to code in is Java, which the group all had experience doing. 
            <br><br>
            Any changes to the original project plan.<br>
            Some deviations were made to the original plan in regards to the calorie counter, due to time constraints it was originally going to be coded with one example, however upon further talks with the tutor, they requested that more examples be provided. 
            <br><br>
            Areas of work that the team would have liked to have done but couldn’t due to time constraints.
            <br><br>
            We would have liked to implement some of the extended features, such as the rewards system, that the group had discussed, however due to time constraints this was not possible. A dark or alternate colour scheme for the application would have also been implemented for people with visual impairment.
            <br><br>
            For the Recipe MVF, the functionality would have preferred to be different than it currently is. Instead of tapping on the recipe to display it, swiping on that recipe would have been the ideal method for viewing it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="2">Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Outcome to date: What are the outcomes of your project? <br>
            For our project we have several MVFs and EVFs, to be precise 5 MVFs and 3 EVFs. MVFs and EVFs are Calorie Counter, Goal Setting, Social Sharing, Recipe/Meal suggestion, motivational videos and Reward system, Exercise Geolocation, Graphics and Statistics. So far at the date of 17/10/2020 we finished all our MVFs, the Figma design before start coding the App and at 16/10/2020 Friday we have had a meeting to ensure everyone finished their own MVFs and the one I’m doing is goal setting, other team members will have different MVF. The First outcome we have successfully reached is the final design of the APP, we spend a lot of time and effort to finish our design for the APP in 2 weeks’ time, each team member had their own taste of aesthetic and we still manage to put everyone’s design together in order to form the final design of our Fitness APP. The second outcome we have achieved is the coding of the APP, at this point, everyone will have to code their design into the APP to make it function and looks exactly how we designed it on Figma. First, it took a while for us to learn the new code or how to use different software (Android Studio) that we have never touched before, but the outcome is still impressing as the work and code are working perfectly fine before the deadline, we have set on 16/10/20. The last outcome we have made for our project should be the writing part of this project, before starting our APP we must have a detailed plan and stories to introduce our features MVFs and EVFs, these are all completely before Assignment part 3 in good quality and quantity to briefly cover everything we need to announce to the users and others.
            <br><br>
            What will you be able to demonstrate in your presentation?<br>
            As a member in the Team, I think I will demonstrate my own part of MVF (Goal Setting) in the presentation, talking about its features and how it works with different graphs I made, one good example is the user context diagram, shows how users can interact with my features step by step. Other than the MVF I think I can still demonstrate a strong understanding and passion in how I want to make this feature even more successful than the other MVFs out there, and that’s exactly what I did for assignment part 1, my user stories are longer than the normal length to be expected and the details I put in is obvious. Other than presenting my MVF and description in details I think that is it for me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="3">Scope creep</h2>
        <p>We had strong project management and team communication since the start of the project which helped us extensively with our project. We did not have to make any major changes with our scope of the project.
            However, the minor changes we had with the app were related to the API’s as we were not able to purchase them. Due to this we could not implement the social media API keys and the Location API key for the Social Sharing MVF and the Exercise and Geolocation EVF, respectively.
        </p>
        <h2 id="4">Windfall</h2>
        <p>Most of us were able to finish our assigned MVF design and coding quicker than expected through Android Studio. We originally estimated that we would finish the coding of each MVF after about 20-30 hours of work but we were pleasantly surprised when we managed to complete them by around the 10-20 hour mark, which allowed us to double check each other's MVFs with the extra time left over. The main component of coding that most of us were able to complete faster than expected was the design aspect. Coding the interface and layout of each page was a lot easier than expected and gave us more time to perfect the interactions and functionality of each page.

        </p>
        <h2 id="5">Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Was the project completed according to schedule?<br>
            Yes, everything part of this project is completed on time and completed according to the schedule. Every week we will have a meeting on Monday and Friday to ensure our work progress is on track and whatever problems we can discuss with other team members on Teams by private messaging them. Also, for these who don’t get or really stuck on something we will open another meeting on Sat morning usually to set up a help session to see what are the problems.
            <br><br>
            Did you make changes to the schedule?<br> 
            Yes, I would say. Because of other assignments from another course as well. Not all of us can finish 3 assignments that are due in a week. Therefore, our team member sometimes will tell us beforehand in the meeting on how they want to push the deadline of their work/part to delayed by few days and everyone is ok with that as long as they finished their work on time. But personally, I did not make any changes to the schedule I’m trying my best to finished all the work within the deadline I set or every member has set. Plus, each week we have recorded what we did for the past week in Trello, our Trello basically is a schedule telling us what to do and telling the assessor what we did for the past weeks before we completed the project. And on Trello we have all our resources, such as GitHub links to Assignment 1,2and3 all part and work are saved there, we also using AWS to store our own website there to host it online.

        <h2 id="6">Testing</h2>
        <p>What testing has been performed?<br>
            We did some test with my MVF (Goal Setting), before We upload the code of our MVFs to GitHub we have tested the functionality a few times before we send it to other teammates to merge it together. The test we did is testing each button, to see if they go to the right page or perform it function properly other than testing button, we checked the java codes to see if they have any red lines or error when running the code and other than these 2 tests subject, we haven’t tested anything else.
            <br><br>
            Did this result in any changes?<br>
            Yes, luckily, we checked the code of the design and the function code for the button. In the end we get to fix them all by applying the correct code and function to each unique button that will work in different pages.
            Have any of your plans for testing changed during the project?
            No, because all my changes are pretty much small changes just some errors in code and button function problems, therefore, it won’t take more than a day to fix it issue approximately 2-3hours and therefore it will definitely not affect my plans for the project. 
            <br><br>
            What would you do differently if you had your time again?<br>
            we will definitely read all the specs when it just come out and decides on things what we can finish it first and what are the thing we need to learn beforehand such as code and design or skills in using different software.

        <h2 id="7">Tools&Technologies</h2>
        <p> Android Studio<br>
            https://developer.android.com/studio<br>
            Android Studio is an official development environment used for designing and developing applications for the Android operating system. It is quite a useful tool as it can be used on Windows, MacOS and Linux systems, meaning that each group member has easy access to the tool.
            We'll be using the latest version of Android Studio (4.0.1) and is free to download and use on all platforms.
            <br><br>
            Visual Studio Code<br>
            https://code.visualstudio.com<br>
            We will likely be using Visual Studio Code again for the development of our website, VSC will be used for the HTML and CSS coding aspect of our website. It is easy to use and automatically formats code when needed, we'll be using the latest version of Visual Studio Code for both Mac and Windows computers.
            <br><br>
            GitHub<br>
            https://github.com/login<br>
            GitHub is of course where we store all our code for our website as we can easily make changes collaboratively and safely without erasing each other's work. We are all familiar with GitHub's interface and all have easy access to both the website version and the desktop version. Some of us are using the desktop version while the rest are using the website version purely just as a matter of preference.
