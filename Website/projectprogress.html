        <h2 id="1">Description</h2>
        <p>Description When we first started this project, we began with what our project was going to be. As a group we chose a mobile fitness application because we felt that during the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic that many peoples
            health and fitness would be poor. This application would be beneficial for us as a group as well as the general public. After we had decided on the topic of this project, we transitioned to the planning phase, deciding on the goals of the
            project as well as the scope which would be met with specific features to achieve the goals.
            <br><br> Our planning phase was not too long, we managed, as a group, to decide on which features to implement into our application relatively quickly. The biggest challenge however was that all of us had not done a mobile application before
            and we lacked the knowledge and experience required to actually implement the features and to estimate the time required to do so. After some discussion, we had formulated a list of features that would exist in a working prototype of this
            project, which included some extra features if time permitted to implement them.
            <br><br> Initially the group did not progress compared with the plan which had been created as the group was confused with what was required for the assignments and didn’t realise that coding was meant to be done across the whole duration
            of the course and not just for the third assignment. However once that confusion had been rectified, the group, for the most part, was able to get their work done according to a more condensed plan.
            <br><br> Dead-ends
            <br> In regards to social sharing, when the share button is pressed it would be ideal to send it to the specific social media platform (e.g. Facebook), but this requires an API, which we couldn’t use as it costs money.
            <br><br> Pivotal decisions made<br> A pivotal decision made was the platform on which we wanted our application to be on, in the end we decided on Android. This is mainly because it is much easier to code an application with, as well as the
            majority of the group having android phones, making it easier to do testing. Another important decision made was the software used for development of the application; as a group we chose Android Studio. We chose Android Studio because it is
            well known and the language in which to code in is Java, which the group all had experience doing.
            <br><br> Any changes to the original project plan.<br> Some deviations were made to the original plan in regards to the calorie counter, due to time constraints it was originally going to be coded with one example, however upon further talks
            with the tutor, they requested that more examples be provided.
            <br><br> Areas of work that the team would have liked to have done but couldn’t due to time constraints.
            <br><br> We would have liked to implement some of the extended features, such as the rewards system, that the group had discussed, however due to time constraints this was not possible. A dark or alternate colour scheme for the application
            would have also been implemented for people with visual impairment.
            <br><br> For the Recipe MVF, the functionality would have preferred to be different than it currently is. Instead of tapping on the recipe to display it, swiping on that recipe would have been the ideal method for viewing it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="2">Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Outcome to date: What are the outcomes of your project?<br> The outcomes of our project link directly to each of our 5 MVFs which include, Calorie Counting, Goal Setting, Social Sharing, Recipe/Meal Suggestions and Motivational Videos. We have
            completely finished the user interface of our mobile application prototype and have completed the majority of functionality that we wished to complete. Our Calorie Counter functionality is mostly complete, we would have liked to have created
            a larger database of meals to search from but wasn't able to within the time constraints. Our Social Sharing feature is finished up until the point of using each social media's platform API to share to their app, obviously it would have been
            great to implement these APIs but their costs were too high out of our interests. Overall the front-end of our app is completely finished while some aspects of the back end could have benefited from an extended time period to work with.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="3">Scope creep</h2>
        <p>We had strong project management and team communication since the start of the project which helped us extensively with our project. We did not have to make any major changes with our scope of the project. However, the minor changes we had with
            the app were related to the API’s as we were not able to purchase them. Due to this we could not implement the social media API keys and the Location API key for the Social Sharing MVF and the Exercise and Geolocation EVF, respectively.
        </p>
        <h2 id="4">Windfall</h2>
        <p>Most of us were able to finish our assigned MVF design and coding quicker than expected through Android Studio. We originally estimated that we would finish the coding of each MVF after about 20-30 hours of work but we were pleasantly surprised
            when we managed to complete them by around the 10-20 hour mark, which allowed us to double check each other's MVFs with the extra time left over. The main component of coding that most of us were able to complete faster than expected was the
            design aspect. Coding the interface and layout of each page was a lot easier than expected and gave us more time to perfect the interactions and functionality of each page.

        </p>
        <h2 id="5">Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Was the project completed according to schedule?<br> Thanks to our effective and critical time management, everything was completed on time and completed and according to the schedule. Every week we will had meeting's on Monday and Friday
            to ensure we were on track and also to discuss the problems we had.
            <br><br> Did you make changes to the schedule?<br> Yes, we did occasionally make minor changes to our schedule as sometimes we had submissions for other courses.

        <h2 id="6">Testing</h2>
        <p>What testing has been performed?<br> We did some test with my MVF (Goal Setting), before We upload the code of our MVFs to GitHub we have tested the functionality a few times before we send it to other teammates to merge it together. The test
            we did is testing each button, to see if they go to the right page or perform it function properly other than testing button, we checked the java codes to see if they have any red lines or error when running the code and other than these 2
            tests subject, we haven’t tested anything else.
            <br><br> Did this result in any changes?<br> Yes, luckily, we checked the code of the design and the function code for the button. In the end we get to fix them all by applying the correct code and function to each unique button that will
            work in different pages. Have any of your plans for testing changed during the project? No, because all my changes are pretty much small changes just some errors in code and button function problems, therefore, it won’t take more than a day
            to fix it issue approximately 2-3hours and therefore it will definitely not affect my plans for the project.
            <br><br> What would you do differently if you had your time again?<br> we will definitely read all the specs when it just come out and decides on things what we can finish it first and what are the thing we need to learn beforehand such as
            code and design or skills in using different software.

        <h2 id="7">Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <p><b> Android Studio</b><br><br>
            <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">https://developer.android.com/studio</a>
            <br><br> Android Studio is an official development environment used for designing and developing applications for the Android operating system. It is quite a useful tool as it can be used on Windows, MacOS and Linux systems, meaning that each
            group member has easy access to the tool. We'll be using the latest version of Android Studio (4.0.1) and is free to download and use on all platforms.
            <br><br><b>Visual Studio Code</b><br><br>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>

            <br><br> We will likely be using Visual Studio Code again for the development of our website, VSC will be used for the HTML and CSS coding aspect of our website. It is easy to use and automatically formats code when needed, we'll be using
            the latest version of Visual Studio Code for both Mac and Windows computers.
            <br><br><b> GitHub</b>
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://github.com/login">https://github.com/login</a>

            <br><br> GitHub is of course where we store all our code for our website as we can easily make changes collaboratively and safely without erasing each other's work. We are all familiar with GitHub's interface and all have easy access to both
            the website version and the desktop version. Some of us are using the desktop version while the rest are using the website version purely just as a matter of preference.
