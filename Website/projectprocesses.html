        <h2 id="what">What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn't worked well?</h2>
        <p>We have learnt that good communication ensures great teamwork within the group and that this only comes from trusting in each other and forming a social bond between us. And that is what worked great for us in this group project, we were all clear
            and supportive of each other and communicated often when problems arose. Whether the communication came from online meetings or MS Teams text chat, we always had regular communication. What didn't happen to work as well and could do with some
            improvement, was our time management. It wasn't the worst but it wasn't up to the standard which we would've liked it to be at. Often we found ourselves completing tasks with only a few hours until the deadline and scheduled times.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 id="mentor">What use did you make of your Mentor? What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you? What were the group processes for communication? How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?</h2>
        <p>We made some use of our mentor in the stand-up meetings, asking for feedback and input when we required it. For example clarifying parts of the assignments, asking for input on ways to implement features within the application and design choices
            within the application.</p>

        <p>We made some use of our lecturer in guiding us. Especially at the start when we were forming a plan for the project as he was able to suggest some things in order to make our lives easier. One aspect that we would have liked more assistance with
            would have been the designing of the application in regards to system context diagrams and similar design aspects.</p>

        <p>The group's main form of communication was through Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams was used as our hub to communicate our ideas and have group meetings. Most of the discussions took place during those meetings as we worked as a group to effectively
            discuss matters at hand and schedule the next meetings, which were then promptly put into our other form of communication; Trello. Trello was used to organise each member's tasks and to communicate to each other member what each person was
            responsible for. We also used it as a platform to keep track of what was required in each assignment.</p>

        <p>Overall both Microsoft Teams and Trello were very effective in regards to organisation and communication between each team member.</p>

        <p>The only change we made since the start of the semester is that we started to schedule more meetings as time progressed, realising that we, as a group, needed to communicate more often.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="organisation">From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?</h2>
        <p>We found that the most important aspect of organising such projects is communication and trust. This can easily be achieved in face-to-face meetings but unfortunately that just wasn't possible this semester with quarantine and COVID-19, so we
            definitely had to work harder than we normally would to earn each other's trust and use MS Teams to communicate frequently. </p>
        <p>Something that we would do differently next time would be to read rubric and specification documents more clearly as our first assignment was our worst result. We barely checked over the content of each other's work and it really showed when he
            had varying results for each section of the assignment so this is definitely an area we would need to improve on if we were to start again.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="advice">What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</h2>
        <p>Some advice we would give to a similar group would be to start early so that time management never becomes an issue, and ensure that communication is clear and a regular occurrence within the group. Doing certain exercises such as ice-breakers
            can help achieve trust and clear communication which we feel is vital when completing group projects. It could also be beneficial for an individual to take the role of a group leader or scrum master to keep things progressing smoothly and
            to schedule. That is what helped us and worked well for our group project and believe that this is great advice for not just groups embarking on a similar project, but for any group project of sorts. </p>
