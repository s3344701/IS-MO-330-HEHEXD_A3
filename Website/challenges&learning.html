        <h2 id="foundEasy">What have we found easy</h2>
        <p>
            Since our idea of a fitness app was simple, it was found easy to design the architecture of the project. Also, due to our prior knowledge to using Figma, LucidChart, AWS, HTML and CSS, prototyping our app design and implementing our work onto a website
            was easy and not challenging.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="foundDifficult">What have we found difficult</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we found that using Android Studio challenging due to the fact that we all had no experience to using it prior to this project. Since we all did not have prior experience to building a mobile app, planning, estimating the amount time needed
            and amount of resources needed was difficult. Our lack of knowledge towards making a mobile app required us to do research however heavy workload from other courses impacted our time in researching and spending time discovering the full potential
            of using Android Studio.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="unexpected">What was unexpected</h2>
        <p>
            We previously had experience in using Java and we thought our previous experience into building an interface would be similar however it turned out to be false. After using the Android Studio IDE, the structure by which to make an application was completely
            unknown to us before. For example, we never expected that we will be using XML files for the app manifests and layout, and also we never expected that the Android Studio IDE is a system built on Gradle, which is used to automate building,
            testing and deployment tasks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="expected">Challenges we were expecting, to address and to overcome</h2>
        <p>
            We were expecting some technical difficulties regarding the implementation of each feature into an Android application due to our lack of knowledge into using Android Studio. Due to our lack of knowledge, a lot of team members did not understand how to
            implement the features into the Android app and since one of our team member fully understood how the Android Studio IDE worked, he wrote a guide illustrating how to correctly use the Android Studio IDE.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="skillAndExperience">New skills & experience we have learned</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of the new skills that we have learned fell under building the mobile app in Android with Android SDK. We have learned how to write an XML file and most importantly learned new ways of coding with Java. Though apart from the technical aspect, we
            all have learned that great communication and support within the team substantially sped up the progress of completing the work for the assignment website and coding of our app.
            <br><br> On the other hand, we found that the weather feature that would have been shown on the home informing the user about the weather outside is more complicated to implement than we anticipated. One of the reason for the difficulty is
            that Google Weather API has been deprecated as of August 07, 2019 and now to add the weather feature we had to code manually of extracting data from and external source. Unfortunately, due to the lack of time, we had to hard code the weather
            information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="planChanges">Plan changes & what changes we would have made to it</h2>
        <p>
            Our original plan was only changed to a minute amount. The majority of the minimum viable features were implemented as planned, however what was changed was that we were not able to make a database to record the user's information such as the calorie
            intakes, exercises done and locations saved. Though for one of our Recipe MVF, we were able to implement a JSON database where the recipe page loads up information based on the content contained in the JSON file. Also due to the time constraint,
            the extended viable features, such as the Reward System, Exercise Geolocation and Progress and Statistics, were not implemented in the Android prototype.
            <br><br> If we were to do this project again, our aim and goals would have been very similar but we would put more emphasis on fully completing the minimum viable features as we have discovered that making a JSON database was not challenging
            as we initially expected. We would also expand our platform coverage as instead of being just Android, we would implement our application on iOS, Mac and Windows devices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="timetableRealistic">Was our timetable realistic</h2>
        <p>
            Due to no prior knowledge into building an Android application before, we were very uncertain into how much time was needed to be spent into implementing our app design into the Android SDK. Hence, our timetable was initially un-realistic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="toolsAndTech">Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected</h2>
        <p>
            The tools and technologies we used, ranging from the front-end user interface with Figma, to the back end of JSON database and mobile client with Android Studio, all worked as we expected. However, the issues we faced mainly fell under trying to implement
            the location services such as the Google Maps API and the Weather API. We realised trying to implement those features would require more technically work and would cost us a lot of time.
