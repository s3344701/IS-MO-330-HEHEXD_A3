        <h2 id="foundEasy">What have we found easy</h2>
        <p>
            Since our idea of a fitness app was simple, it was found easy to design the architecture of the project. Also, due to our prior knowledge to using Figma, LucidChart, AWS, HTML and CSS, prototyping our app design and implementing our work onto a website
            was easy and not challenging.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="foundDifficult">What have we found difficult</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, we found that using Android Studio challenging due to the fact that we all had no experience to using it prior to this project. Since we all did not have prior experience to building a mobile app, planning, estimating the amount time needed
            and amount of resources needed was difficult. Our lack of knowledge towards making a mobile app required us to do research however heavy workload from other courses impacted our time in researching and spending time discovering the full potential
            of using Android Studio.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="unexpected">What was unexpected</h2>
        <p>
            We previously had experience in using Java and we thought our previous experience into building an interface would be similar however it turned out to be false. After using the Android Studio IDE, the structure by which to make an application was completely
            unknown to us before. For example, we never expected that we will be using XML files for the app manifests and layout, and also we never expected that the Android Studio IDE is a system built on Gradle, which is used to automate building,
            testing and deployment tasks.

        <h2 id="skillAndExperience">New skills & experience we have learnt</h2>

        <br>
        <h2 id="timetableRealistic">Was our timetable realistic</h2>
        <p>
            Due to no prior knowledge into building an Android application before, we were very uncertain into how much time was needed to be spent into implementing our app design into the Android SDK. Hence, our timetable was initially un-realistic.
