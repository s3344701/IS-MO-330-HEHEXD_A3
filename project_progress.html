    <h1>Project Progress</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When we first started this project, we began with what our project was going to be.
        As a group we chose a mobile fitness application because we felt that during the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic that many peoples health and fitness would be poor. 
        This application would be beneficial for us as a group as well as the general public. 
        After we had decided on the topic of this project, we transitioned to the planning phase, deciding on the goals of the project as well as the scope which would be met with specific features to achieve the goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our planning phase was not too long, we managed, as a group, to decide on which features to implement into our application relatively quickly. 
        The biggest challenge however was that all of us had not done a mobile application before and we lacked the knowledge and experience required to actually implement the features and to estimate the time required to do so. 
        After some discussion, we had formulated a list of features that would exist in a working prototype of this project, which included some extra features if time permitted to implement them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially the group did not progress compared with the plan which had been created as the group was confused with what was required for the assignments and didn’t realise that coding was meant to be done across the whole duration of the course and not just for the third assignment. 
        However once that confusion had been rectified, the group, for the most part, was able to get their work done according to a more condensed plan. 
    </p>

    <h2>Dead-ends</h2>
    <p>
        The team did not experience too many dead-ends however, the calorie counter was a lot more complex than originally thought and as such was not completed in time as the team member responsible for the feature did not complete it.   
    </p>
    <p>
        In regards to social sharing, when the share button is pressed it would be ideal to send it to the specific social media platform (e.g. Facebook), but this requires an API, which we couldn’t use as it costs money.
    </p>

    <h2>Pivotal decisions made</h2>
    <p>
        A pivotal decision made was the platform on which we wanted our application to be on, in the end we decided on Android. 
        This is mainly because it is much easier to code an application with, as well as the majority of the group having android phones, making it easier to do testing. 
        Another important decision made was the software used for development of the application; as a group we chose Android Studio. 
        We chose Android Studio because it is well known and the language in which to code in is Java, which the group all had experience doing. 
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to the original plan</h2>
    <p>
        Some deviations were made to the original plan in regards to the calorie counter,
         due to time constraints it was originally going to be coded with one example, 
         however upon further talks with the tutor, they requested that more examples be provided. 
    </p>

    <h2>Areas of work that the team would have liked to have done but couldn’t due to time constraints.</h2>
    <p>
        We would have liked to implement some of the extended features, such as the rewards system, that the group had discussed, however due to time constraints this was not possible.
        A dark or alternate colour scheme for the application would have also been implemented for people with visual impairment.
        For the recipe mvf, the functionality would have preferred to be different than it currently is. 
        Instead of tapping on the recipe to display it, swiping on that recipe would have been the ideal method for viewing it.
